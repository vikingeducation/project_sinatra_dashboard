1. Sinatra gets a request for the index page

2. A helper module gets info from scraping and sends to index.erb, which renders the page


3. Refreshing the page should kick off scraping operations
	- scraper should be a helper module

4. There should be a form for my search query that tells the scraper what to search for
	- form with what they would like to search for Position and Location

5. Display the job hunt data in a table on the page
	- render the view appropriately

6. Load bootstrap into sinatra app and use it to style the job hund widget
