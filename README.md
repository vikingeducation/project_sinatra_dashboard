# project_sinatra_dashboard
let's go for an apartment hunt!

[A Ruby and Sinatra project that uses web scraping with the Mechanize gem from the Viking Code School](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com)

First, run `bundle install` to make sure you have the required gems.  
Then, run `ruby app.rb` from the app's directory to start the server.   
Head to what *should* be `localhost:4567` and search away!
