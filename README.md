# project_sinatra_dashboard
let's go for an apartment hunt!

[A Ruby and Sinatra project that uses web scraping with the Mechanize gem from the Viking Code School](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com)

Worked on by [Roy Chen](https://github.com/roychen25)

## Getting Started
A toy app that scrapes company data from indeed.com.sg (in fact, it only works for jobs from Singapore at the moment).

Built with Ruby and Sinatra. Integrates with the FreeGeoIP API for geolocating visitor locations, and with the Glassdoor API to obtain company ratings and featured reviews.

## Running this app
Fork and clone the repo, change to the repo directory, then run:

```
ruby app.rb
```

Access `http://localhost:4567` to get started.
